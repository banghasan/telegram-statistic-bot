# Telegram Group Stats Bot

A Telegram bot that tracks user activity in groups and displays statistics
through a Mini Web App. Built with [Bun](https://bun.sh/),
[GramIO](https://gram.io/), and `bun:sqlite`.

## Features

- **User Activity Tracking**: Monitors messages, words, stickers, and media
  (photos, videos, etc.) sent by users in a group.
- **Dual Mode**: Can be run in either `polling` or `webhook` mode.
- **Personal Stats**: Users can get their own statistics by using the `/stats`
  command in a group.
- **Group Leaderboard**: The `/leaderboard` command provides a deep link that
  opens a native Telegram Mini App displaying the top 10 most active users in
  the group.
- **Admin View**: Bot owner and admins can view statistics for any group the bot
  is a member of, directly from the web app.
- **Secure**: Web app data is verified using HMAC signatures to ensure requests
  are legitimate.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the bot.

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) installed on your
machine.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 4. Configure the Bot

Create a `config.yml` file by copying the example:

```bash
cp config.example.yml config.yml
```

Now, edit `config.yml` with your own values:

- **`bot.token`**: Your Telegram bot token from
  [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
- **`bot.mode`**: Set to `polling` to start, or `webhook` for production.
- **`bot.webhook.url`**: If using webhook mode, the public URL for your webhook
  (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/bot`).
- **`bot.webhook.port`**: The port for the server to listen on (for both webhook
  and the web app).
- **`webapp.url`**: The public URL for your Mini Web App. This can be the same
  as your webhook URL, but without the `/bot` path. See the note below.
- **`owner`**: The Telegram User ID of the bot's owner.
- **`admins`**: A list of Telegram User IDs for users who should have admin
  privileges.

**A Note on Public URLs:** For the Mini Web App and Webhook mode to work,
Telegram needs to access the bot from a public HTTPS URL. When developing
locally, the bot runs a server (e.g., on port `8080`). You will need a tool like
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose this local server to the internet.

Example using ngrok:

```bash
ngrok http 8101
```

Ngrok will give you a public `https` URL (e.g.,
`https://xxxx-xxxx.ngrok-free.app`). Use this for your `webapp.url` and
`bot.webhook.url` in the config file.

### 5. Run the Bot

Once configured, you can start the bot:

```bash
bun start
```

The console will show that the web server and the bot have started in the
configured mode.

## How It Works

1. **Add the Bot to a Group**: Make the bot a member of your Telegram group. It
   will automatically start tracking messages.
2. **Get Your Stats**: Type `/stats` in the group. The bot will reply with your
   personal statistics for that group.
3. **View the Leaderboard**: Type `/leaderboard` in the group. The bot will show
   a button.
4. **Open the Mini Web App**: Click the button. This will open a private chat
   with the bot and automatically send you a Mini App button.
5. **Launch Mini App**: Click the Mini App button in the private chat to view
   the group's top 10 most active users in a native Telegram Mini App.
6. **Admin View**: If you are listed as an `owner` or `admin` in the config, the
   web app will show a dropdown menu allowing you to view the stats for any
   group the bot is in.

> **Note**: The Mini App opens in a private chat because Telegram's `web_app`
> button type only works in private chats, not in groups. This approach provides
> the best native Telegram Mini App experience.

## Development

This project uses [Biome.js](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting.

- **Check for issues**:
  ```bash
  bun check
  ```
- **Fix linting errors**:
  ```bash
  bun lint
  ```
- **Format the code**:
  ```bash
  bun format
  ```
